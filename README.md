# Research Project: Subsidence Vulnerability Index (SVI) Modeling

Welcome to the repository for Subsidence Vulnerability Index (SVI) Modeling research project. This repository contains the code and data used in our research, along with documentation and instructions for usage.

## Overview

This repository is part of a research paper titled "AI-Powered Multiple Modeling of Land Subsidence Vulnerability based on Cluster Analysis due to Groundwater Over-abstraction" authored by Sorush Mohammadi, Sina Sadeghfam, Ata Allah Nadiri, Senapathi Venkatramanan, Abu Reza Md. Towfiqul Islam, Yong Xiao, Mehdi Rahmati. The summary of the paper is as follows:
The land subsidence triggered by groundwater over-abstraction is a topical research activity and this study calculates the Subsidence Vulnerability Index (SVI) based on the basic ALPRIFT framework and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to decrease the inherent subjectivity in ALPRIFT. The AI modes were formulated based on Inclusive Multiple Modeling (IMM), in which Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) conducted a cluster analysis at Level 1, and the identified clusters were entered into another RF model at Level 2. This formulation was implemented on the Sarab unconfined aquifer, distressed by water table decline, which identified hotspots in the central part of the aquifer. The AI models at both levels substantially increase the modeling performance compared to the basic ALPRIFT regarding the ROC curve and confusion matrix. However, a slight improvement was also observed at Level 2 compared with Level 1.
